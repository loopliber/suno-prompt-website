# How to Make Melodies with Suno AI

Creating a memorable melody is the difference between a track that’s instantly replayable and one that fades after a single listen. Suno AI can generate surprisingly strong melodic shapes—if you guide it with intentional structure.

In this guide you’ll learn a **practical, repeatable workflow** to coax stable, catchy, emotionally aligned melodies out of Suno, even when the raw generations feel chaotic.

---
## Quick Summary (TL;DR)
| Goal | Prompt Ingredient | Why It Matters |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Catchy hook | Short 4–8 note motif | Gives model an anchor |
| Emotional tone | Mood + dynamic adjectives | Shapes interval & contour bias |
| Memorability | Repetition + variation pair | Human-like phrasing |
| Cohesion | Key + tempo + genre | Reduces wandering patterns |
| Lift | Pre-chorus lift cue | Encourages rising contour |

---
## 1. Define a Core Motif First
Instead of asking Suno for a full melodic journey immediately, **prime it with a motif concept**.

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
core motif: short ascending 4-note hook with a memorable leap, playful, bright, interval focus
```
Add constraints like:
- `no over-ornamentation`
- `avoid random scalar noodling`
- `balanced stepwise + one leap`

> Tip: Words like *hooky*, *singable*, *whistlable*, *memorable* bias Suno toward simpler interval relationships.

---
## 2. Anchor Musical Context
Provide genre + tempo + key to reduce drift.

```
genre: upbeat synth pop
bpm: 118
key: A major
energy: medium-high but controlled
```

If you don’t care about a specific key, still specify a **mode** (e.g. *major*, *minor*, *dorian*) to prevent tonal wobble.

---
## 3. Shape Contour & Emotion
Describe *contour verbs* and *emotional arc*:
```
contour: gentle rise then fall, natural breathing space
dynamics: subtle lift in bar 4
emotion: hopeful, forward-looking, lightly nostalgic
```
These terms encourage *phrasing* instead of a flat random walk.

---
## 4. Use Call & Response Structure
Explicitly request pattern logic:
```
structure: A (bars 1-2), A' (bars 3-4 with small variation), B (answer phrase), return to A hook
```
Add: `cohesive phrasing`, `intentional spacing`, `no meandering filler`.

This increases phrase-level coherence.

---
## 5. Add Pre-Chorus Lift (Optional)
If generating a longer section that feeds into a chorus:
```
pre-chorus cue: gradual pitch ascent, rhythmic tightening, tension-building leading tone
```

---
## 6. Iterative Refinement Loop
1. Generate 3–5 takes.
2. Note what *worked* (e.g. contour, interval shape) vs what failed (aimless chromatic runs). 
3. Re-inject strengths explicitly:
```
keep: the stepwise rise + perfect 4th leap
improve: reduce busy 16th note runs, add clearer cadence at bar 8
```
4. Add: `retain successful hook elements`.

Repeat—this converges fast.

---
## 7. Avoid Common Failure Modes
| Issue | Cause | Counter-Prompt |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Wandering notes | No tonal anchor | specify key + mood |
| Over-busy | No simplicity constraint | `lean, uncluttered` |
| Random runs | Vague contour | `controlled contour, deliberate phrasing` |
| Forgettable | No motif directive | `memorable 4–8 note hook` |

---
## 8. Complete Prompt Template
Combine everything into a single structured Suno input:
```
melodic focus: memorable 4-note ascending hook with one tasteful leap
style: upbeat synth pop, modern, clean
key: A major, diatonic clarity
bpm: 118
structure: A A' B A (8 bars)
contour: gentle rise then fall, bar 4 mini-lift
rhythm: balanced syncopation, no over-chopping
emotion: hopeful, lightly nostalgic, forward momentum
constraints: no aimless noodling, no over-ornamentation, keep singable
variation: subtle in A', contrast in B, return hook resolution
tag words: hooky, whistlable, structured, cohesive
```
Paste that and listen to what changes. Iterate with the refinement loop.

---
## 9. Bonus: Layering for Depth
After a solid primary melody:
- Generate a **counter-melody**: `supportive airy pluck answering main hook`
- Generate a **texture pad**: `sustained warm chords, no competing motion`
- Submix and lightly **sidechain** to retain clarity.

---
## 10. SEO-Friendly Key Takeaways
- Use *motif-first prompting* to get repeatable hooks.
- Control **key, tempo, structure** to stabilize shape.
- Describe **contour + emotional arc** to improve phrasing.
- Iterate by preserving strengths explicitly.
- Apply a structured template for faster convergence.

## FAQ
**Q: Why does Suno give melismas or wandering runs?**  
A: Lack of contour + simplicity prompts. Add `controlled contour`, `intentional spacing`.

**Q: How do I get more emotional lift?**  
A: Ask for a *pre-chorus lift*, rising contour, or `increasing interval tension`.

**Q: Should I name intervals?**  
A: Occasionally. Referencing a single leap (like a *perfect fourth*) can nudge pattern shaping.
